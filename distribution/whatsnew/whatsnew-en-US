What's new in v1.1

Smarter protection, even without the internet:
• Behavioral detection — app now flags callers who hang up repeatedly, call in bursts, or ring briefly and hang up (short-ring bait tactics)
• All behavioral checks run fully on-device, no network needed

TRAI DND 1909 Quick Report:
• Tap "Report to TRAI" on any flagged call to instantly prepare a DND complaint SMS to 1909
• View all prepared complaints under Settings → Reports → Reported Numbers

Community reporting improvements:
• Surge protection — coordinated mass-reporting can no longer artificially inflate a number's score
• More stable spam category labels (requires clear consensus before changing)
